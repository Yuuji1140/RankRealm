# Project: RankRealm

## Objective:
This project aims to democratize competitive gaming by providing a lightweight ranking system tailored for racing games and point-based games. Our goal is to simplify the process of implementing competitive ranking systems, typically only accessible to triple-A studios, for smaller indie developers.

We aim to achieve this by developing an ELO-based ranking system that is user-friendly and easily integrable into existing games. This system will be accompanied by a web interface for easy management and visualization of rankings, as well as an optional API for seamless integration into game environments.

By offering an accessible solution, we strive to empower indie developers to enhance the competitive aspects of their games, fostering vibrant and engaging gaming communities.
